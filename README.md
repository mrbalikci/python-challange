There are two projects in this repository:

1. PyBank

Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. Two sets of revenue data: (`budget_data_1.csv` and `budget_data_2.csv`). 

Each dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Revenue`. 

(The company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period


2. PyPoll

Helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 
(Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be. 

There are two sets of data `election_data_1.csv` and `election_data_2.csv`. Each dataset is composed of three columns: 

`Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 

The task task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
